## NYUST_EE_Digital Image Processing

### uses Csharp to implement some basic image processing methods.


*Lab 01 : Read the image file and display its RGB channel histograms and grayscale.  
*Lab 02 : Implement average grayscale, maximum grayscale, and weighted grayscale.  
*Lab 03 : Implement negative, log-transform, and histogram equalization.  
*Lab 04 : Implement Median Filter, Mean Filter, Maximum Filter, Minimum Filter, adjustable thresholding, and Otsu's thresholding.  
*Lab 05 : Implement image rotation and fisheye image transformation.  
*Lab 06 : Implement image scaling using error diffusion.  
*Lab 07 : Implement dilation and erosionUse . 
*Lab 08 : Opencv implement Lab1~Lab7 . 
*Lab 09 : Implement Canny edge detection, contour finding (Findcontour), and circle detection using HoughCircle in OpenCV.  
*Lab 10 : OpenCV application - Image streaming and real-time image processing .
